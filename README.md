# Data Structure - Hash Table implementation in Java
This is a Data Structures course assignment of Hash Table with AVL Trees as nodes and double Hashing implementation in Java

The project's concept is as a spell-inventory (in video games for example), that store spells (objects) in a hash table and execute queries to get objects of specific types or ranges, described by different attributes of the Spell obejct.
This implementation is both efficient in space and runtime complexity.
